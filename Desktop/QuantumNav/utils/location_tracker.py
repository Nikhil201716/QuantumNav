    Injects JavaScript to get the user's location and update it every few seconds.
    
    This function embeds a JavaScript snippet into the Streamlit app that uses the
    Geolocation API to fetch the user's latitude and longitude. The location data is
    sent to the parent window via postMessage events, which can be processed elsewhere
    (e.g., via query parameters or a custom component).

        interval (int): How often to fetch the location (in seconds). Default is 5 seconds.

    Placeholder function to handle location updates from JavaScript postMessage events.
    
    Due to Streamlit's iframe sandbox limitations, direct event handling via postMessage
    is not possible in the default setup. This function serves as a conceptual placeholder,
    outlining the intended behavior and suggesting workarounds for real-time updates.

    Intended behavior:
        - Listen for postMessage events from the injected JavaScript.
        - Update st.session_state.current_location with the received coordinates (e.g., {'lat': 37.7749, 'lon': -122.4194}).

    Limitations:
        - Streamlit's sandboxed iframes prevent direct JavaScript event listeners.
    
    Workarounds:
        1. Use a custom Streamlit component to handle real-time JavaScript events.
        2. Poll st.session_state or use query parameters to simulate updates (as done in app.py).
